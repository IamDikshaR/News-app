# News-opedia - a news app

News-opedia is a dynamic platform built using ReactJS and TailwindCSS, designed to fetch and display news articles based on user-selected categories or custom search queries. Integrating the News API, the app provides real-time access to a wide range of articles from various sources, allowing users to explore the latest headlines, trending stories, and in-depth reports. With an intuitive interface, responsive design, and features like a searchable news feed and source exploration, the app ensures a seamless and engaging user experience. The search bar is prominently interactive, activating with a blinking cursor upon clicking, and allows users to set their search queries by pressing the Enter key, which enhances the ease of finding relevant news
